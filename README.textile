h1. CloudBees Run@Cloud SBT Plugin

Integration for SBT that lets you deploy apps to the CloudBees RUN@Cloud PaaS

h1. Usage

Firstly, you need to grab the key and secret from grandcentral.cloudbees.com, which should look like:
!https://github.com/timperrett/sbt-cloudbees-plugin/raw/master/notes/img/beehive-keys.jpg!

Once you have these two values, you can do one of two things:

* Enter them when the plugin prompts you; this will be on every time you run a deployment to the cloud
* Create a properties file called bees.config in $HOME/.bees/ so that you only need to define them once per computer. This properties file needs to be a key-value pair style like this:

<pre><code>bees.api.key=XXXXXXXXXX
bees.api.secret=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX=
</code></pre>

Whichever route you choose to specify that information, you then only need to define the plugin information in any given project. 
Specifically, in project/plugins/build.sbt define the following:

<pre><code>resolvers += "sonatype.repo" at "https://oss.sonatype.org/content/groups/public"

libraryDependencies += "eu.getintheloop" %% "sbt-cloudbees-plugin" % "0.3.1"
</code></pre>
 
Add the plugin to your built.sbt project file like so:

<pre><code>seq(bees.RunCloudPlugin.deploymentSettings :_*)
</code></pre>

Again, if you would prefer to enter these values when you deploy your application then you can of course just enter the appropriate values when prompted. Now your all configured and good to go, there are two commands you can run with this plugin:

* Get a list of your configured applications: <code>bees-app-list</code>
* Deploy your application <code>bees-deploy</code>
